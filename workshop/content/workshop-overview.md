* [Backends](https://terraform.io/language/settings/backends) - How the state file is stored
* [Providers](https://terraform.io/language/providers/configuration) - How underlying infrastructure is abstracted away
* [Data Sources](https://terraform.io/language/data-sources) - How data can be fetched or computed for use in your configuration
* [Resources](https://terraform.io/language/resources) - How infrastructure objects are defined
* [Variables](https://terraform.io/language/values) - Values to be reused throughout your configuration
