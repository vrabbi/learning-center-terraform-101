# Backends
Terraform stores the state of the resources it is managing in a
[state file](https://terraform.io/language/state). By default, the
file is written to `terraform.tfstate`{{}} in the current directory. However, in
real-world use cases, it is *critical* that this file be stored in a secure
manner, and backed up in case it is lost or corrupted. Terraform provides
multiple [backends](https://terraform.io/language/settings/backends) to
make this possible.

For this scenario, we will let Terraform write `terraform.tfstate`{{}} to the
current directory.
